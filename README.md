# Exploring Data Visualizations in Python

## Project Purpose
- I was in high school when the ebola outbreak was happening 2013 through 2016. I read a book that was based on a true story of the actual outbreak and was both terrified and fascinated by the subject. While looking for a dataset that interested me, I found this dataset that documents the number of ebola cases and deaths per country over a three year period and decided to use it to create a visualization.

## Tools Used
- I chose to use Python for the project.

## Results
-
