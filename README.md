# Exploring Data Visualizations in Python

## Project Purpose
- I want to learn more about data visualization in Python and practice creating different charts in this language. To do this, I will create at least two different charts visualizing the Ebola outbreak of 2014 and 2015.


## Tools Used
- I chose to use Python for the project because I have less experience with this language. I will use both Altair and Matplotlib to create my charts.

## Results
- Using Altair, I created two different charts and layered them into one chart to show both case and death counts by country. First, I created an area chart that showed the number of cases per country over time. The second chart I created was a line chart that showed the number of deaths per country over time. I then layered them together into one chart and finished it with a title and axis labels.
